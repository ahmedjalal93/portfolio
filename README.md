## Portfolio

This is my React portfolio. This is another apporach of making a profile page using React

I used Swtch routers to navigate though my pages

I seperated my code block into React compounends to be able to use them on multiple pages

I made an inde page wich export all other pages I have so I only import that index file to import all other pages to my app.

I used css/js in my index.html which I have previously built before.

I installed gh-pages to be able to deploy my code to github.

This work is completely front end development, no server or backend is needed to run

The purpose of this work is to learn how to refactor basic html/js/css to React wrapped pages.
